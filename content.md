## ABOUT — OUR STORY

### Page opener
**Title:** Our Story  
**Kicker:** Formed in 1973

**Copy (history):**  
West Wickham Underwater Hockey Club was established in 1973 by a passionate group of divers from the West Wickham (BSAC) diving club. Since then, we have grown into an inclusive club, boasting a diverse collection of members of different ages and backgrounds. The club prides itself on hosting both social and competitive players, with several active members being part of the elite international squad.

**Legacy team photos (content note):**  
Include a small gallery of legacy team photos near the top of the page (image-led, minimal captions).

**Copy (early growth):**  
In our early years, a significant merger with players from Bromley enriched our talent pool, fostering a competitive edge. Our quick establishment in the UK National Ladder set the foundation for decades of success. Throughout the 1980s, notable players like Steve Baldwin, Paul Cook, Pete Coleman, and Paul Allen propelled the club to new heights, earning national championships and representing Great Britain on the international stage.

**Timeline carousel (content note):**

- `/assets/club-journey-12.webp`
- `/assets/club-journey-13.webp`

**Copy (media then vs now):**  
The club has always shared the sport beyond the pool. From the days of printed “Octopush News” booklets, we’ve evolved into modern coverage — local news headlines, regional features (including BBC regional news), and the day-to-day stories, clips, and match moments shared across Instagram and Facebook.

**Copy (branding evolution):**  
Our identity has changed as the club has grown: from the West Wickham reds, through the Dacor Dive sponsorship era, to the legacy wave mark — and into today’s modern WWUWH logo system.

**Copy (1990s and 2000s):**  
The 1990s and 2000s saw continued excellence with our members securing top positions in national and international tournaments. In 1998, we clinched the National Champions title and consistently maintained a top-three ranking.

### Introduction to the Sport
**Title:** Introduction to the sport  
**Copy:**  
Underwater Hockey (UWH), also known as Octopush, is a globally played limited-contact sport where two teams compete to manoeuvre a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team’s goal using a hockey stick (pusher).

Invented by Alan Blake in 1954 as a winter activity to keep members engaged in his diving club, UWH blends swimming skills, fitness, and breath-holding in a unique, underwater environment.

Teams consist of up to 10 players, with 6 in the water at any time. The game is fast-paced, utilising a tag system for substitutions, enhancing its excitement and intensity.

The sport takes hockey to a whole new dimension with the playing area being the bottom of a swimming pool. It’s a truly unique sport requiring the use of snorkelling gear (mask, fins, and snorkel), combining swimming skills, good fitness, and breath-holding as all the action is underwater.

Underwater hockey is a great way to keep fit — taking swimming (widely recognised as excellent for health and fitness) to the next level through a truly unique team sport. The low-contact nature makes it very safe, giving it broad appeal with men’s, women’s, and junior teams — with players from 8 years upwards.

---

### Growth of the Sport
**Title:** Growth of the sport  
**Copy:**  
The 1970s and 80s saw the sport’s first major expansion, fuelled by the rise of scuba diving. Underwater hockey spread globally, becoming popular in Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, and South Africa. Today, it’s a well-organised global sport with national and international events, culminating in the World Championship.

**Key stats (display as simple bullets):**
- 5,400+ UK registered players.
- 110 teams in the UK and over 1,000 teams worldwide.
- From 6 teams at the first World Championship in 1980 to 80 teams in Eger, Hungary in 2013.

## ABOUT — LADIES CLUB

### Page opener
**Title:** Ladies Club  
**Kicker:** Strength • Skill • Sisterhood

**Copy (intro):**  
The ladies community within West Wickham Underwater Hockey Club has long been a beacon of strength, collaboration, and calm confidence under pressure. Underwater hockey has always been a sport where teamwork matters more than size, and where technique, awareness, and resilience win games — qualities our women bring in abundance.

This page celebrates our commitment to creating space for women to train, compete, and thrive — not as a side programme, but as a core part of the club’s identity.

---

### Why it matters
**Title:** Why women’s underwater hockey matters  
**Copy:**  
Women’s training environments build confidence, accelerate skill development, and strengthen community. Dedicated opportunities help players learn faster, push their limits safely, and bring new tactical perspectives into the wider club.

When more women play, the whole club improves — the pace rises, communication sharpens, and our understanding of style, technique, and decision-making grows. Diversity makes us better.

---

### Swickham Ladies
**Title:** Swickham Ladies  
**Kicker:** West Wickham × Sussex Underwater Hockey Club

**Copy:**  
Our successful alliance with Sussex Underwater Hockey Club is a proud example of what happens when great communities come together. Competing as **Swickham Ladies**, we’ve built a supportive, high-performance environment rooted in inclusivity and excellence in women’s underwater hockey.

At the **British Octopush Association (BOA) Women’s Nationals 2025**, Swickham Ladies continued to rise — securing **third place in 2025** and proving that commitment, consistency, and team culture deliver results.

---

### Training and development
**Title:** Dedicated training  
**Copy:**  
Alongside competition, we prioritise training opportunities that support women at every stage — from first session confidence-building to tournament preparation. Expect focused skills work, tactical understanding, and the kind of communication that turns individual ability into team momentum.

**Optional pull-quote (use as a design feature):**  
“Strong teams are built on trust — and trust is built one session at a time.”

---

### Pathway to the top
**Title:** From club sessions to GB selection  
**Copy:**  
We’re proud that a number of female players connected to West Wickham have been selected to play at **GB level**, bringing home medals and raising the standard for everyone. Their journeys show what’s possible when talent meets the right environment: supportive teammates, structured development, and meaningful competition.

**Title:** European Tournaments  
**Kicker:** Play abroad. Come back sharper.

---

### Why we travel
**Section title:** Why tournaments matter

Tournaments give players the fastest route to growth: higher tempo games, different tactics, and the pressure that turns training into instinct. Just as importantly, they’re a chance to experience the international underwater hockey community — welcoming, diverse, and brilliantly competitive.

**Bullets (scannable):**
- Sharpen skills against unfamiliar playing styles  
- Build team chemistry through intense match blocks

### Creative layout idea (for the page build)
**Concept:** “Pinboard Map” (not a carousel)  
- Use a simple **UK + Europe silhouette SVG** as a background panel.  
- Place clickable “pins” for each location (London/UK events + Europe cities).  
- Clicking a pin opens a **mini lightbox** with 1–3 photos + a short caption (“Berlin”, “Parma”, “Kranj — 3rd place”, etc.).  
- Keep it lightweight: pins are absolutely positioned; photos pulled from the list above.  
- Accessibility: pins are buttons with proper labels; lightbox closes with Escape.

**Fallback (mobile):** a clean **masonry grid** of images with location tags (Berlin / Prague / Parma / etc.).

### Closing CTA
**Title:** Want to join a tournament trip?

  kicker: "Fundraising"
  title: "Channel Swim for MNDA"
  intro: "On 31 May 2018, West Wickham Underwater Hockey Club took on our biggest charity event yet: swimming the distance of the English Channel and back underwater — in just one hour — to support our founding member Paul Cook."
---

## The challenge

On **31 May 2018**, West Wickham Underwater Hockey Club embarked on our biggest charity event yet: to collectively swim the distance of the English Channel and back underwater (**66,600m**) wearing standard UWH equipment (**mask, snorkel and fins**) whilst holding our breath — **all within just 1 hour**.

This challenge was created in support of one of our founding members, **Paul Cook**, who was diagnosed with **Motor Neurone Disease**.

We were delighted to raise **£20,380** for **MNDA**, and swam the distance of the English Channel not twice, but **three times**.

---

## Why we did it

Paul started his UWH playing career at West Wickham in **1974**, aged just **14**. He captained our Elite team for **17 years**, winning the **National Championship** three times and the **European Club Championship** once. Paul represented **Great Britain** at **five World Championships**, winning **two Silver** and **two Bronze** medals.

It was special to have Paul with us at our Christmas session — and as anybody who knows Paul will tell you, he couldn’t just watch. He was encouraging his two children **Beth & Harry**, and even got involved in the match and scored.

We’re raising money for pioneering **Stem Cell treatment** for Paul, and for future research and support provided by the **Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA)**.

---

## Together, in and out of the pool

This event showed what a club can do when everyone pulls together. From planning and fundraising, to filling lanes with swimmers and supporters, the whole club came together — not just to complete the challenge, but to do it safely, fairly, and as one team.

### How it was measured

To keep the swim accurate and accountable:

- **Lane ropes** were used to keep swimmers flowing smoothly and safely.
- Each swimmer had a **dedicated counter/monitor** to track lengths and confirm totals.
- Distances were recorded in **widths** and converted into **metres** for the final results.
- Team groupings (hat colours and team letters) were also tracked to keep the atmosphere competitive and fun.

After the hour was up, we celebrated the donation total together — and held an award moment for the **most metres swum**, won by **James**.

**Title:** Kit Guide  
**Copy:**  
You don’t need everything on day one — but the right kit makes the sport safer, more comfortable, and more fun. Ask the team for guidance before buying, and always follow BOA guidelines.

**Starter kit (for first sessions)**
- Mask
- Snorkel
- Fins
- Mouth guard (recommended)

---

### Fins
**Copy:**  
Fins are essential for enhancing speed and agility in the water. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced player, the right fins can make a significant difference in game.

**Key notes**
- Styles range from affordable full-foot plastic/rubber fins for beginners to high-performance (and more expensive) fibreglass / carbon fibre fins for advanced players.
- Fins must meet British Octopush Association (BOA) guidelines.
- Seek advice from the local underwater hockey community to try on and find the best fit.

### Masks
**Copy:**  
Masks are essential for clear vision and comfort during play. The right mask can enhance both performance and enjoyment by ensuring a secure fit and optimal visibility.

**Key notes**
- Options range from affordable single-lens masks to pricier frameless or curved masks.
- A proper fit with a good seal is crucial to prevent leaks and fogging.
- Look for high-quality silicone masks with easy-to-adjust straps.
- Higher quality masks can be more expensive, but offer better fits and durability — a worthwhile investment.

### Snorkels
**Copy:**  
A snorkel is vital for comfortable breathing during gameplay. The right snorkel can greatly enhance your performance in play.

**Key notes**
- Options include traditional snorkels (simple, cost-effective), dry snorkels (with a valve to prevent water entry), and semi-dry snorkels (with a splash guard to reduce water intake).
- Focus on comfort (shape, attachment), ease of quickly clearing water when rising, and durability.

### Sticks
**Copy:**  
Sticks are crucial for effective puck control and gameplay in underwater hockey. The right stick can significantly impact a player’s performance based on position and playing style.

**Key notes**
- Options range from offensive sticks like the **Carve** by Bentfish Designs (popular among forwards) to defensive sticks that are longer and straighter (ideal for backs).
- Selecting a stick that matches the player’s role — agile and responsive for forwards, longer and stronger for defensive play — is essential.
- All sticks must meet BOA guidelines.
- A well-chosen stick enhances puck control, shot accuracy, and overall effectiveness in the water.

### Gloves
**Copy:**  
Gloves play a vital role in underwater hockey, offering protection and enhancing grip during play. Selecting the right gloves is essential for performance and compliance with BOA guidelines.

**Key notes**
- According to BOA guidelines, gloves should typically be blue or dark in colour to avoid confusion with the puck.
- Gloves are available in various materials (including silicone), from basic to high-end specialised designs.
- Material affects grip and durability, while a snug, comfortable fit supports puck handling and stick control.
- Forwards may prioritise dexterity; backs may prefer extra protection. Choose gloves that suit your role and meet BOA standards.

Mouth guards are essential for protecting teeth and gums during underwater hockey. Selecting the right mouth guard is crucial for safety while maintaining comfort and focus.

**Key notes**

- A well-fitting mouth guard is vital for effective protection without compromising breathing or concentration.
- Ensure the mouth guard adheres to BOA guidelines for safety.

### Hats
**Copy:**  
Hats are crucial for player identification and safety in underwater hockey, often featuring team colours or club/country branding. Proper selection of a hat helps maintain uniformity and protection during play.

**Key notes**
- Hats usually include ear guards and are made from materials like latex or neoprene, with varying levels of customisation and quality.
- A well-fitting hat should stay in place during play and provide sufficient ear protection.
- Hats often display numbers (1–15) for player identification. Choose a hat that follows your league/BOA guidelines.
- Whether generic or club/country branded, the right hat supports team identity and player safety.

### Fin Retainers

Fin retainers help keep fins securely in place during fast-paced underwater hockey matches. Proper retainers prevent equipment issues and maintain performance.

**Key notes**
- Available in various styles and materials (rubber or neoprene straps), sometimes with club/country branding.
- A secure and comfortable fit is essential to prevent fins slipping off in critical moments.
- Ensure retainers are compatible with your fins and meet local league/BOA guidelines.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/fin-retainers.webp`

### Socks
**Copy:**  
Neoprene socks and specialised tape provide additional foot protection and comfort inside fins. The right foot protection can reduce blisters and abrasions and improve comfort during play.

**Key notes**
- Available in various thicknesses, sometimes with club/country branding. Prices vary by material quality and customisation.
- Choose the right balance of cushioning and grip without compromising fin fit.
- Socks/tape should align with local league/BOA guidelines.

### Swimwear
**Copy:**  
Competitive swimwear for underwater hockey can improve performance and help display club or national pride through branding. A good suit supports team unity and identification while offering performance benefits.

**Key notes**
- Custom suits often feature logos or team colours for club/country affiliation.
- Fit and drag reduction matter most for performance.
- Prices vary depending on customisation and material quality.
- Ensure swimwear adheres to local league/BOA guidelines for competition standards.

### Pucks
**Copy:**  
Underwater hockey pucks are designed for visibility and performance, typically weighing around **1.2kg** so they remain at the bottom of the pool. The right puck supports accurate passing and shooting.

**Key notes**
- Pucks come in bright colours for improved visibility and may feature club/country branding.
- Made from materials such as rubber or coated lead; weight and composition affect glide and handling.
- Pucks must meet local league/BOA guidelines for consistency and fair play.

### Goals
**Copy:**  
Underwater hockey goals are crucial for a safe and standardised playing environment. Typically **3 metres** each, goals should be durable and safe for players.

**Key notes**
- Often made from stainless steel to prevent rust, with seam-welded construction and smooth surfaces to minimise injury risk.
- Designed without cutting edges to reduce hazards during gameplay.
- Goals must meet local league/BOA safety and sizing guidelines.
