## ABOUT — OUR STORY

### Page opener
**Title:** Our Story  
**Kicker:** Formed in 1973

**Copy (history):**  
West Wickham Underwater Hockey Club was established in 1973 by a passionate group of divers from the West Wickham (BSAC) diving club. Since then, we have grown into an inclusive club, boasting a diverse collection of members of different ages and backgrounds. The club prides itself on hosting both social and competitive players, with several active members being part of the elite international squad.

**Legacy team photos (content note):**  
Include a small gallery of legacy team photos near the top of the page (image-led, minimal captions).

**Copy (early growth):**  
In our early years, a significant merger with players from Bromley enriched our talent pool, fostering a competitive edge. Our quick establishment in the UK National Ladder set the foundation for decades of success. Throughout the 1980s, notable players like Steve Baldwin, Paul Cook, Pete Coleman, and Paul Allen propelled the club to new heights, earning national championships and representing Great Britain on the international stage.

**Timeline carousel (content note):**

- `/assets/club-journey-12.webp`
- `/assets/club-journey-13.webp`

**Copy (media then vs now):**  
The club has always shared the sport beyond the pool. From the days of printed “Octopush News” booklets, we’ve evolved into modern coverage — local news headlines, regional features (including BBC regional news), and the day-to-day stories, clips, and match moments shared across Instagram and Facebook.

**Copy (branding evolution):**  
Our identity has changed as the club has grown: from the West Wickham reds, through the Dacor Dive sponsorship era, to the legacy wave mark — and into today’s modern WWUWH logo system.

**Copy (1990s and 2000s):**  
The 1990s and 2000s saw continued excellence with our members securing top positions in national and international tournaments. In 1998, we clinched the National Champions title and consistently maintained a top-three ranking.

### Introduction to the Sport
**Title:** Introduction to the sport  
**Copy:**  
Underwater Hockey (UWH), also known as Octopush, is a globally played limited-contact sport where two teams compete to manoeuvre a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team’s goal using a hockey stick (pusher).

Invented by Alan Blake in 1954 as a winter activity to keep members engaged in his diving club, UWH blends swimming skills, fitness, and breath-holding in a unique, underwater environment.

Teams consist of up to 10 players, with 6 in the water at any time. The game is fast-paced, utilising a tag system for substitutions, enhancing its excitement and intensity.

The sport takes hockey to a whole new dimension with the playing area being the bottom of a swimming pool. It’s a truly unique sport requiring the use of snorkelling gear (mask, fins, and snorkel), combining swimming skills, good fitness, and breath-holding as all the action is underwater.

Underwater hockey is a great way to keep fit — taking swimming (widely recognised as excellent for health and fitness) to the next level through a truly unique team sport. The low-contact nature makes it very safe, giving it broad appeal with men’s, women’s, and junior teams — with players from 8 years upwards.

---

### Growth of the Sport
**Title:** Growth of the sport  
**Copy:**  
The 1970s and 80s saw the sport’s first major expansion, fuelled by the rise of scuba diving. Underwater hockey spread globally, becoming popular in Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, and South Africa. Today, it’s a well-organised global sport with national and international events, culminating in the World Championship.

**Key stats (display as simple bullets):**
- 5,400+ UK registered players.
- 110 teams in the UK and over 1,000 teams worldwide.
- From 6 teams at the first World Championship in 1980 to 80 teams in Eger, Hungary in 2013.

**Copy (intro):**

**Copy:**  
Women’s training environments build confidence, accelerate skill development, and strengthen community. Dedicated opportunities help players learn faster, push their limits safely, and bring new tactical perspectives into the wider club.

**Copy (story):**

The club raised **£20,380 for MNDA**, and the team didn’t stop at the target — completing the channel distance three times.

**Sponsors (list):**
- The CRM Agency
- Cisco
- Santander

**Optional closing line:**

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/masks.webp`

---

### Snorkels
**Copy:**  
A snorkel is vital for comfortable breathing during gameplay. The right snorkel can greatly enhance your performance in play.

**Key notes**

### Sticks
**Copy:**  
Sticks are crucial for effective puck control and gameplay in underwater hockey. The right stick can significantly impact a player’s performance based on position and playing style.

**Key notes**
- Options range from offensive sticks like the **Carve** by Bentfish Designs (popular among forwards) to defensive sticks that are longer and straighter (ideal for backs).
- Selecting a stick that matches the player’s role — agile and responsive for forwards, longer and stronger for defensive play — is essential.
- All sticks must meet BOA guidelines.
- A well-chosen stick enhances puck control, shot accuracy, and overall effectiveness in the water.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/sticks.webp`

---

### Gloves
**Copy:**  
Gloves play a vital role in underwater hockey, offering protection and enhancing grip during play. Selecting the right gloves is essential for performance and compliance with BOA guidelines.

**Key notes**
- According to BOA guidelines, gloves should typically be blue or dark in colour to avoid confusion with the puck.
- Gloves are available in various materials (including silicone), from basic to high-end specialised designs.
- Material affects grip and durability, while a snug, comfortable fit supports puck handling and stick control.
- Forwards may prioritise dexterity; backs may prefer extra protection. Choose gloves that suit your role and meet BOA standards.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/gloves.webp`

---

### Mouth Guard
**Copy:**  
Mouth guards are essential for protecting teeth and gums during underwater hockey. Selecting the right mouth guard is crucial for safety while maintaining comfort and focus.

**Key notes**
- Options range from basic boil-and-bite models (low cost) to more advanced designs like the S.E.G.
- A well-fitting mouth guard is vital for effective protection without compromising breathing or concentration.
- Ensure the mouth guard adheres to BOA guidelines for safety.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/mouthguard.webp`

---

### Hats
**Copy:**  
Hats are crucial for player identification and safety in underwater hockey, often featuring team colours or club/country branding. Proper selection of a hat helps maintain uniformity and protection during play.

**Key notes**
- Hats usually include ear guards and are made from materials like latex or neoprene, with varying levels of customisation and quality.
- A well-fitting hat should stay in place during play and provide sufficient ear protection.
- Hats often display numbers (1–15) for player identification. Choose a hat that follows your league/BOA guidelines.
- Whether generic or club/country branded, the right hat supports team identity and player safety.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/hats.webp`

- Ensure retainers are compatible with your fins and meet local league/BOA guidelines.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/fin-retainers.webp`

### Socks
**Copy:**  
Neoprene socks and specialised tape provide additional foot protection and comfort inside fins. The right foot protection can reduce blisters and abrasions and improve comfort during play.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/swimwear.webp`

### Pucks
**Copy:**

**Key notes**
- Pucks come in bright colours for improved visibility and may feature club/country branding.
- Made from materials such as rubber or coated lead; weight and composition affect glide and handling.
- Pucks must meet local league/BOA guidelines for consistency and fair play.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/pucks.webp`

### Goals
**Copy:**  
Underwater hockey goals are crucial for a safe and standardised playing environment. Typically **3 metres** each, goals should be durable and safe for players.

- Designed without cutting edges to reduce hazards during gameplay.
- Goals must meet local league/BOA safety and sizing guidelines.
