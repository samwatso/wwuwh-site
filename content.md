## ABOUT — OUR STORY

### Page opener
**Title:** Our Story  
**Kicker:** Formed in 1973

**Copy (history):**  
West Wickham Underwater Hockey Club began in 1973, founded by divers from the West Wickham (BSAC) diving club. Over the years we’ve grown into a welcoming club with members across ages and backgrounds — from social players to those competing at the highest level.

A merger in the early years strengthened the club’s depth and competitiveness, and West Wickham quickly established itself on the UK national ladder. Across the decades, club players have helped shape our story through championship wins and international representation.

### Introduction to the sport
**Title:** Introduction to the sport  
**Copy:**  
Underwater Hockey (UWH), also known as Octopush, is a limited-contact team sport played on the bottom of a swimming pool. Two teams use a short stick (pusher) to move a puck into the opposing goal — with all the action underwater.

**Key facts (bullets):**
- Invented as a winter training game for divers, UWH blends swimming, fitness, and breath-hold in a unique environment.
- Squads typically have up to 10 players, with 6 in the water at a time, using rolling substitutions.

**Inspirational line (optional):**  
Quiet above. Chaos below. That’s the magic.

### Growth of the sport (optional stats block)
**Title:** Growth of the sport  
**Copy:**  
From its early expansion alongside the rise of scuba diving, underwater hockey became a global sport with national leagues and international championships.

**Stat bullets (as a simple display):**
- 5,400+ UK registered players  
- 110 UK teams; 1,000+ teams worldwide  
- World Championships have grown from 6 teams (1980) to 80 teams (2013)

## ABOUT — FUNDRAISING

### Page opener
**Title:** Fundraising  
**Story title:** Channel swim for the Motor Neurone Disease Association

**Copy (story):**  
On 31 May 2018, WWUWH took on our biggest charity challenge: collectively swimming the equivalent of the English Channel and back underwater (66,600m) in just one hour — wearing standard underwater hockey kit and holding our breath between lengths. The swim was in support of founding member Paul Cook following his Motor Neurone Disease diagnosis.

The club raised **£20,380 for MNDA**, and the team didn’t stop at the target — completing the channel distance three times.

**Sponsors (list):**
- The CRM Agency
- Cisco
- Santander

**Optional closing line:**
- When we move together, we can go further than anyone expects.

## KIT GUIDE
## KIT GUIDE

### Page opener
**Title:** Kit Guide  
**Copy:**  
You don’t need everything on day one — but the right kit makes the sport safer, more comfortable, and more fun. Ask the team for guidance before buying, and always follow BOA guidelines.

**Starter kit (for first sessions)**
- Mask
- Snorkel
- Fins
- Mouth guard (recommended)

---

### Fins
**Copy:**  
Fins are essential for enhancing speed and agility in the water. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced player, the right fins can make a significant difference in game.

**Key notes**
- Styles range from affordable full-foot plastic/rubber fins for beginners to high-performance (and more expensive) fibreglass / carbon fibre fins for advanced players.
- Fins must meet British Octopush Association (BOA) guidelines.
- Seek advice from the local underwater hockey community to try on and find the best fit.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/fins.webp`

### Masks
**Copy:**  
Masks are essential for clear vision and comfort during play. The right mask can enhance both performance and enjoyment by ensuring a secure fit and optimal visibility.

**Key notes**
- Options range from affordable single-lens masks to pricier frameless or curved masks.
- A proper fit with a good seal is crucial to prevent leaks and fogging.
- Look for high-quality silicone masks with easy-to-adjust straps.
- Higher quality masks can be more expensive, but offer better fits and durability — a worthwhile investment.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/masks.webp`

---

### Snorkels
**Copy:**  
A snorkel is vital for comfortable breathing during gameplay. The right snorkel can greatly enhance your performance in play.

**Key notes**
- Options include traditional snorkels (simple, cost-effective), dry snorkels (with a valve to prevent water entry), and semi-dry snorkels (with a splash guard to reduce water intake).
- Focus on comfort (shape, attachment), ease of quickly clearing water when rising, and durability.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/snorkels.webp`

---

### Sticks
**Copy:**  
Sticks are crucial for effective puck control and gameplay in underwater hockey. The right stick can significantly impact a player’s performance based on position and playing style.

**Key notes**
- Options range from offensive sticks like the **Carve** by Bentfish Designs (popular among forwards) to defensive sticks that are longer and straighter (ideal for backs).
- Selecting a stick that matches the player’s role — agile and responsive for forwards, longer and stronger for defensive play — is essential.
- All sticks must meet BOA guidelines.
- A well-chosen stick enhances puck control, shot accuracy, and overall effectiveness in the water.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/sticks.webp`

---

### Gloves
**Copy:**  
Gloves play a vital role in underwater hockey, offering protection and enhancing grip during play. Selecting the right gloves is essential for performance and compliance with BOA guidelines.

**Key notes**
- According to BOA guidelines, gloves should typically be blue or dark in colour to avoid confusion with the puck.
- Gloves are available in various materials (including silicone), from basic to high-end specialised designs.
- Material affects grip and durability, while a snug, comfortable fit supports puck handling and stick control.
- Forwards may prioritise dexterity; backs may prefer extra protection. Choose gloves that suit your role and meet BOA standards.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/gloves.webp`

---

### Mouth Guard
**Copy:**  
Mouth guards are essential for protecting teeth and gums during underwater hockey. Selecting the right mouth guard is crucial for safety while maintaining comfort and focus.

**Key notes**
- Options range from basic boil-and-bite models (low cost) to more advanced designs like the S.E.G.
- A well-fitting mouth guard is vital for effective protection without compromising breathing or concentration.
- Ensure the mouth guard adheres to BOA guidelines for safety.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/mouthguard.webp`

---

### Hats
**Copy:**  
Hats are crucial for player identification and safety in underwater hockey, often featuring team colours or club/country branding. Proper selection of a hat helps maintain uniformity and protection during play.

**Key notes**
- Hats usually include ear guards and are made from materials like latex or neoprene, with varying levels of customisation and quality.
- A well-fitting hat should stay in place during play and provide sufficient ear protection.
- Hats often display numbers (1–15) for player identification. Choose a hat that follows your league/BOA guidelines.
- Whether generic or club/country branded, the right hat supports team identity and player safety.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/hats.webp`

---

### Fin Retainers
**Copy:**  
Fin retainers help keep fins securely in place during fast-paced underwater hockey matches. Proper retainers prevent equipment issues and maintain performance.

**Key notes**
- Available in various styles and materials (rubber or neoprene straps), sometimes with club/country branding.
- A secure and comfortable fit is essential to prevent fins slipping off in critical moments.
- Ensure retainers are compatible with your fins and meet local league/BOA guidelines.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/fin-retainers.webp`

---

### Socks
**Copy:**  
Neoprene socks and specialised tape provide additional foot protection and comfort inside fins. The right foot protection can reduce blisters and abrasions and improve comfort during play.

**Key notes**
- Available in various thicknesses, sometimes with club/country branding. Prices vary by material quality and customisation.
- Choose the right balance of cushioning and grip without compromising fin fit.
- Socks/tape should align with local league/BOA guidelines.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/socks.webp`

### Swimwear
**Copy:**  
Competitive swimwear for underwater hockey can improve performance and help display club or national pride through branding. A good suit supports team unity and identification while offering performance benefits.

**Key notes**
- Custom suits often feature logos or team colours for club/country affiliation.
- Fit and drag reduction matter most for performance.
- Prices vary depending on customisation and material quality.
- Ensure swimwear adheres to local league/BOA guidelines for competition standards.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/swimwear.webp`

---

### Pucks
**Copy:**  
Underwater hockey pucks are designed for visibility and performance, typically weighing around **1.2kg** so they remain at the bottom of the pool. The right puck supports accurate passing and shooting.

**Key notes**
- Pucks come in bright colours for improved visibility and may feature club/country branding.
- Made from materials such as rubber or coated lead; weight and composition affect glide and handling.
- Pucks must meet local league/BOA guidelines for consistency and fair play.

**Suggested image (asset):** `/assets/kit/pucks.webp`

---

### Goals
**Copy:**  
Underwater hockey goals are crucial for a safe and standardised playing environment. Typically **3 metres** each, goals should be durable and safe for players.

**Key notes**
- Often made from stainless steel to prevent rust, with seam-welded construction and smooth surfaces to minimise injury risk.
- Designed without cutting edges to reduce hazards during gameplay.
- Goals must meet local league/BOA safety and sizing guidelines.
