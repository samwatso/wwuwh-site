## ABOUT — OUR STORY

### Page opener
**Title:** Our Story  
**Kicker:** Formed in 1973

**Copy (history):**  
West Wickham Underwater Hockey Club began in 1973, founded by divers from the West Wickham (BSAC) diving club. Over the years we’ve grown into a welcoming club with members across ages and backgrounds — from social players to those competing at the highest level.

A merger in the early years strengthened the club’s depth and competitiveness, and West Wickham quickly established itself on the UK national ladder. Across the decades, club players have helped shape our story through championship wins and international representation.

### Introduction to the sport
**Title:** Introduction to the sport  
**Copy:**  
Underwater Hockey (UWH), also known as Octopush, is a limited-contact team sport played on the bottom of a swimming pool. Two teams use a short stick (pusher) to move a puck into the opposing goal — with all the action underwater.

**Key facts (bullets):**
- Invented as a winter training game for divers, UWH blends swimming, fitness, and breath-hold in a unique environment.
- Squads typically have up to 10 players, with 6 in the water at a time, using rolling substitutions.

**Inspirational line (optional):**  
Quiet above. Chaos below. That’s the magic.

### Growth of the sport (optional stats block)
**Title:** Growth of the sport  
**Copy:**  
From its early expansion alongside the rise of scuba diving, underwater hockey became a global sport with national leagues and international championships.

**Stat bullets (as a simple display):**
- 5,400+ UK registered players  
- 110 UK teams; 1,000+ teams worldwide  
- World Championships have grown from 6 teams (1980) to 80 teams (2013)

## ABOUT — FUNDRAISING

### Page opener
**Title:** Fundraising  
**Story title:** Channel swim for the Motor Neurone Disease Association

**Copy (story):**  
On 31 May 2018, WWUWH took on our biggest charity challenge: collectively swimming the equivalent of the English Channel and back underwater (66,600m) in just one hour — wearing standard underwater hockey kit and holding our breath between lengths. The swim was in support of founding member Paul Cook following his Motor Neurone Disease diagnosis.

The club raised **£20,380 for MNDA**, and the team didn’t stop at the target — completing the channel distance three times.

**Sponsors (list):**
- The CRM Agency
- Cisco
- Santander

**Optional closing line:**
- When we move together, we can go further than anyone expects.

## KIT GUIDE

### Page opener
**Title:** Kit Guide  
**Copy:**  
You don’t need everything on day one — but the right kit makes the sport safer, more comfortable, and more fun. Ask the team for guidance before buying, and always follow BOA guidelines.

**Starter kit (for first sessions)**
- Mask
- Snorkel
- Fins
- Mouth guard (recommended)

### Sections (use anchors on page)
#### Fins
**Copy:**  
Fins are the engine. Beginners often start with affordable full-foot fins, while advanced players may move to higher-performance materials. Fit matters most — try options and ask for advice.

#### Masks
**Copy:**  
Choose a mask with a reliable seal and comfortable strap. Good silicone and a proper fit reduce leaks and fogging.

#### Snorkels
**Copy:**  
A comfortable snorkel helps you breathe efficiently between dives. Prioritise comfort, durability, and ease of clearing water quickly.

#### Sticks (Pushers)
**Copy:**  
Stick choice depends on your position and style. Forwards often prefer agile offensive shapes; backs may prefer longer, straighter options for reach and defence. All sticks should meet BOA guidelines.

#### Gloves
**Copy:**  
Gloves protect your hands and improve grip. Choose a snug fit that matches your role — dexterity for forwards, extra protection for backs — and ensure compliance with BOA guidelines.

#### Mouth Guard
**Copy:**  
Mouth guards protect teeth and gums. A snug fit is essential for protection without compromising breathing or focus. Options range from boil-and-bite to advanced designs.

#### Hats (Caps)
**Copy:**  
Caps help with safety and identification, typically with ear protection and player numbers. A secure fit keeps the cap in place during fast play and supports consistent team kit standards.

#### Fin Retainers
**Copy:**  
Retainers keep fins secure during bursts of speed and contact. Choose a comfortable strap style that works with your fins and stays put.

#### Socks / Foot protection
**Copy:**  
Neoprene socks and protective tape can reduce blisters and improve comfort inside fins. Choose the thickness that still allows a secure fin fit.

#### Swimwear
**Copy:**  
A secure, streamlined suit helps performance and comfort. Many players choose club- or country-branded suits for unity and identification.

#### Pucks
**Copy:**  
Underwater hockey pucks are designed to stay on the pool bottom and slide cleanly. Use compliant pucks for fair play and consistent handling.

#### Goals
**Copy:**  
Goals should be durable and safe — smooth surfaces and compliant sizing help protect players and keep play consistent.
